# PROBABILITY THEORY
The sole purpose of this repo is to illustrate the various ways one can code probabilities.

### **Probability theory** 

A branch of mathematics concerned with the analysis of random phenomena. The outcome of a random event cannot be determined before it occurs, but it may be any one of several possible outcomes. The actual outcome is considered to be determined by chance.

The basic ways of coding probabilties are illustrated in the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Tobi-DataDetective/Coding_Probabilities/blob/master/DAN%20Probabilities.ipynb).

### Truth Table
A truth table is a mathematical table used in logic—specifically in connection with Boolean algebra, boolean functions, and propositional calculus—which sets out the functional values of logical expressions on each of their functional arguments, that is, for each combination of values taken by their logical variables.

### Conditional Probability
The probability of an event ( A ), given that another ( B ) has already occurred.
